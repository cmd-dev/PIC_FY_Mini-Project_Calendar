Conclusion: 

It can be concluded that by the use of an array of structures, switch cases, for and while loops along with conditional and logical checks to find day zero ,check whether a year is a leap year, and check if the date is valid, a program that can display a monthly calendar of the year which shows when notes are saved,  what date a particular date is created etc. can be made.
